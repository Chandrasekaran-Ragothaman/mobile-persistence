A-Team Mobile Persistence Accelerator
=====================================
The A-Team Mobile Persistence Accelerator (AMPA) is a lightweight persistence and data synchronization framework developed by the Oracle Mobile A-Team. 
AMPA works on top of Oracle Mobile Application Framework (MAF).
It eases the consumption of RESTful services, and provides a complete persistence layer that allows you to use the mobile application in offline mode. 
You can read and write data while not connected to the internet, and synchronize any pending data changes later when you are online again.
The design-time wizards that are integrated with JDeveloper enable you to build a fully functional mobile application within minutes.

The accelerator is distributed as an open source framework and hosted on github at https://github.com/oracle/mobile-persistence

See the github wiki for instructions on installing and getting started.
